# DHLExpress Web Services

A library for accessing DHLExpress API

##Acknowledge
- The base library was created using github's spysystem/wsdl2phpgenerator library (which forks the original project from wsdl2phpgenerator) and then adjusted.

- The ::setAuthenticationHeader() method in GblExpressRateBook class is based on the code created by Cedric Ziel, for his dreipunktnull/dhl-express library.
